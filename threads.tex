\section{Introduction}

A thread is an execution context that belong to a process.
A process might contain several threads which share some resources : memory and file descriptors.

Sometimes called lightweight process.
Process with single thread : code, data, and files in common, single registers and stack. 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|ccc|}
\hline
	Code & Data & Files\\
	\hline
	Register & & Stack\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{center}
Process with multiple threads : code, data, and files in common, multiple registers and stacks.

\end{center}
Process with single thread : code, data, and files in common, single registers and stack.
Process with multiple threads : code, data, and files in common, multiple registers and stacks.

Advantages :
lighter management (especially context switch)
take advantage of concurrency within a process ( eg can perform a computation during a blocking system call in another thread).
Communication between threads is easier/more efficient than IPC (Inter Process Communication) between processes.

Example : Webserver
The main thread can listen to connextions while other threads handle requests
Accesses to Webserver data can be performed concurrently and overlapped with computations

\section{Thread Models}

Threads might be :\\

Preemptive : threads might be interrupted asynchronously to switch to another thread. \\
Cooperative : the thread itself release the PCU to let another thread be scheduled.\\

Advantages/Drawbacks :\\

For preemptive : \\
Insensitive to misbehaving threads.\\
Can take advantage of multiple CPUS.\\
higher cost (context switch) \\

For cooperative :\\
easier to programm and debug  because not sensitive to data races ( will be explained later) \\
can only take advantage of a single CPU \\
more efficient
