Let's prove that best[i, j] gives the optimal value.

If i == j or if j-i == 1, it's obviously optimal

If j-i > 1 :
	We have to choose between two decisions :
	1) If we take the left card:
		The new score is C[i]Â + Value(i+1, j-1)
						or C[i] + Value(i, j-2) 
			depending on the choice of the sister
			where Value(i, j) is the score that we will get thanks to our decision

		In the algorithm, we take Value=Best, and we know that best(i+1, j-1) and best(i, j-2) are both optimal

		As a consequence, assuming that we take the left card, will get an optimal score
	
	2) If we take the right card:
		Same reasoning with C[i] + Value(i+1, j-1)
						or C[i] + Value(i+2, j)

		So assuming that we take the right card, we get an optimal score
	
	In the algorithm, we take the maximum of the 2 optimal scores we got.

	As it's the maximum, we get the optimal score independently of the
	fact that we take the right or left card => It's optimal
