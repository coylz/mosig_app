First Session :
Richard wrote a skeleton for the game (found in main_richard.txt)

We think about using a tree
Each node is a decision in picking a card
(each node has two sons)
We build the whole tree with all possible decisions and we compute the maximum
	=> big memory space (2^26 ~ 100MB)

New method :
We build each branch one by one
Once we get a valid solution => we keep it
	=> problem : not the BEST solution
